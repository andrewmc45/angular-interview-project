Angular Interview Project
-------------------------

A basic Angular application for user registration and profile viewing.

Features:
- Register with name, email, password, and bio.
- View profile after registration.

Setup:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Start with `ng serve` and access at `http://localhost:4200/`.

Notes:
- Utilizes mock APIs for registration and profile data.
- Protected profile page with an authentication guard.
- Run tests using `ng test`.

Open questions: 
1.What is a successful submission of this form – is it any valid data or the King Julien

2.There is no password in the mock data (I assumed it was for security because I wouldn’t store a password locally in clear text)
